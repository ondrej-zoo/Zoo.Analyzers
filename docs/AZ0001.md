# AZ0001 - File-scoped namespace should be followed by an empty line

This is too squeezed and clunky.

````csharp
namespace Zoo.Analyzers;
public class MyClass
{
}
````

There should be at least one empty line after the file-scoped namespace declaration.
```csharp
namespace Zoo.Analyzers;

public class MyClass
{
}
````
